---

## BACKLOG — Single canonical list of all open work
**RULE: This is the ONE place for all TODOs. Always read this before proposing next steps.**

### V2 UI Redesign — DONE 2026-04-10
- [x] **V2 Redesign: Generate → Review → Publish** — Complete UI overhaul. Dropped calendar/scheduling. New `posts` table as central entity. New pages: Batch Generate (with content recipe from rules), Review Posts, Ready to Publish. Added "Save as Post" to Image Post, Reel, Carousel pages. `publish_post()` wrapper in publisher.py. Old pages archived to `_archive/`. Navigation: Create / Review / Publish / Media Library / Tools.

### Content Production (enable batch content creation) — LEGACY (pre-V2)
- [x] **Batch calendar creative workflow** — Generate scenarios for all calendar slots in one click → review/accept/reject via Drafts Review → generate videos → music → assemble. Long-running batch pattern. DONE 2026-03-06.
- [x] **Content type routing** — Route system replaces format: feed/carousel/reel-kling/reel-veo/reel-slideshow. Each route defines full production path. Batch Pipeline routes slots by route, no manual model selector. Rules page updated with route selectbox. Calendar shows route badges + generated content preview (video players, carousel thumbnails). DB migration: carousel_drafts gets calendar_id FK. DONE 2026-03-09.
- [x] **Production Workflow UX Redesign** — Stepper pipeline with inline review on Production Pipeline page. Gates between steps, scenarios grouped by slot with accept-one pattern, captions as final step. Calendar shows multi-step pipeline progress badges (Sc/Vid/Mus/Comp). Drafts Review renamed to Content Drafts with slot grouping toggle. Shared review component extracted to `app/components/review_controls.py`. DONE 2026-03-10.
- [x] **Pipeline UX fixes** — Rejected videos/scenarios/music no longer block regeneration. Inline review requires feedback text for rejection. Caption step only counts production-ready slots (feed always, reels after composite, veo after accepted video, carousel excluded). Calendar dot color reflects pipeline progress (green=ready, orange=in-progress, blue=has content). DONE 2026-03-10.
- [x] **Route-based tabs + 1:1 calendar status mapping** — Pipeline page rewritten with 1 tab per route (Image Posts / Carousel / Reel Kling / Reel Veo / Slideshow), each self-contained with settings + pipeline steps. Settings moved from sidebar to inline rows per tab. Shared helpers extracted (`_render_scenario_step`, `_render_video_step`, `_render_music_step`, `_render_composite_step`, `_render_caption_step`). `creative_status` now updated on accept/reject (not just batch generation). Calendar badges read `creative_status` column directly — removed 6 prefetch queries for ~6x faster Calendar page loads. Legacy status mapping for backward compat. DONE 2026-03-10.
- [x] **Pipeline + Calendar UX feedback fixes** — Accepted items show compact detail cards (thumbnail, description, video/audio player, re-reject option). "Composite" renamed to "Video + Music" everywhere. Caption step gated on prerequisite steps completion. Calendar list view re-optimized with batch fetches for content preview. Grid view shows note to switch to List for details. Re-rejection of accepted items with mandatory feedback. `is_excluded` column on `media_library` for blacklisting bad media (IMG_6738.PNG excluded). DONE 2026-03-11.
### Drafts Review UX (short-term polish) — DONE 2026-03-09
- [x] **Scenario thumbnails** — Source photo thumbnail shown next to scenario description in Drafts Review
- [x] **Carousel preview in Drafts Review** — Full IG-style carousel preview with `render_ig_preview_carousel()` inline, side-by-side with captions + hashtags
- [x] **Accept feedback** — Feedback text works on both accept and reject. Placeholder: "what's good or bad about this?"
- [x] **Clarify scenario purpose** — `:violet[Video scenario]` badge in scenario expander headers
- [x] **Rating tooltip** — Help text on rating slider: "Your quality assessment: 1 = poor, 5 = excellent. Used to improve future AI prompts."
- [x] **Video size in Drafts Review** — Constrained video player to 2/3 width for better fit on screen

- [ ] **Batch retry failed posts** — Add "Retry Failed" button to Batch Generate results or Review page. Re-run generation for existing failed post rows instead of creating new ones. Currently must regenerate entire batch.
- [ ] **Batch photo enhancement (Phase 2.5B)** — Bulk-enhance ~94 low-quality media (ig_quality < 5). Re-run Claude Vision, keep if +2 improvement. Add DB columns: enhanced_url, enhanced_quality, enhancement_method. Upload to `Generated/Enhanced/` in Drive. Folder already created.
- [ ] **Auto-retarget** — Outpaint photos to 4:5 (feed) and 9:16 (story/reel) in batch

### Video & Creative
- [x] **Veo 3.1 integration (B1)** — Google Veo 3.1 Fast/Standard as second video model. `veo_generator.py` service, `VIDEO_MODELS` dispatch, dedicated AI Lab page `12_Veo_Video.py`. Duration 4/6/8s, resolution 720p/1080p. Needs `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- [x] **Carousel support (B2)** — Multi-image IG posts. `carousel_drafts` DB table, `carousel_queries.py` CRUD, `publisher.py` carousel functions, `13_Carousel_Builder.py` AI Lab page with AI-assisted (theme suggestions, image selection, caption generation) + manual picker, reorder, IG preview with dots/arrows, save/publish. Optimized with paginated gallery + dict lookups.
- [x] **Persistent cost tracking** — `cost_log` DB table, `cost_tracker.py` service (`log_cost` fire-and-forget in all 8 services, 13 call sites), `14_Cost_Dashboard.py` with KPI metrics + cost-by-tool breakdown + filterable recent calls table. All API calls auto-logged: Claude, Veo, Kling, Stability AI, Replicate, MusicGen.
- [x] **Creative Scenarios on Veo page** — Added "3 Creative Scenarios" and "From scenario" prompt modes to Veo page. Generate, review, accept/reject scenarios, load prompts directly into video generation.
- [ ] **End image support** — Show hotel facade at end of Kling videos (needs `end_image` param for transitions)
- [ ] **Seasonal & Element Variants** — Transform photos to different seasons (summer → winter), add elements, object removal. Placeholder prompt exists: `SEASONAL_TEMPLATE` in creative_transform.py but not wired.
- [ ] **AI Humor** — Dedicated humor scenario mode for creative transforms

### AI Lab Direct Publish — DONE 2026-03-11
- [x] **Standalone IG publish from AI Lab pages** — Shared `render_publish_to_ig()` component in `app/components/ig_publish.py`. Caption + hashtags input, confirmation dialog, upload → IG Graph API flow with cleanup. Added to: Veo Video (after video generation), Photo-to-Video (Tab 1 video + Tab 3 composite), Carousel Builder (reel export, replacing inline code). Credentials check shows warning if `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` not configured.

### Publishing & Analytics (Phase 5b)
- [ ] **Optimal posting times** — Instagram Graph API insights for best times to post
- [ ] **Post performance table** — `post_performance` table (engagement metrics)
- [ ] **Feedback loop** — Pull IG metrics 48h after publication, feed back into scoring
- [ ] **Publication dashboard** — Stats, best performing content, trends
- [ ] **Auto-push validated slots** — No manual export, direct queue
- [ ] **Replicabilite multi-hotel** — Malaga property support

### UX Polish (low priority)
- [ ] **Rethink Content Drafts page** — Mostly redundant now that Production Pipeline has inline review. Consider: remove entirely (AI Lab pages have their own accept/reject), or repurpose as "Prompt Improvement" page showing rejected items grouped by reason.

### Prompts & Content Quality
- [ ] **Translate prompts to English** — Most prompts in `/src/prompts/` are in French (caption_generation, creative_transform, tone_variants). destination_content is already English.
- [ ] **Separate HOTEL_CONTEXT** — Split into (1) hotel identity/facts and (2) "what works on Instagram" ideas list. Currently both in `HOTEL_CONTEXT` in `src/prompts/creative_transform.py`.
- [ ] **Enrich DESTINATION_CONTEXT** — Add owner's specific restaurant recommendations, favorite spots to `src/prompts/destination_content.py` (placeholder currently)
- [ ] **Sitges Knowledge Base page** — Streamlit admin page to manage Sitges knowledge dynamically instead of static `DESTINATION_CONTEXT`

### Monitoring & Ops
- [ ] **API change monitor agent** — Weekly automated check of all tool providers (Replicate, Google Gemini, Stability AI, Anthropic) for new models, pricing changes, new API capabilities. Report via WhatsApp.

### Testing & Maintenance
- [ ] **Test Streamlit Cloud after deploy** — Reboot app from dashboard, verify music playback works in Drafts Review (Drive token refresh). Also check Batch Pipeline route summary + Calendar route badges.
- [ ] **User testing Phase 2.5A** — Test AI enhancement with real STABILITY_API_KEY + REPLICATE_API_TOKEN
